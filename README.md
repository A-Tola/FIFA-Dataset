# FIFA-Dataset
Dataset cleaning challenge
Like any real-world dataset, this FIFA dataset is not without its challenges. Data cleaning is essential in preparing the FIFA dataset for further analysis and visualisation.
For the purpose of this challenge, Iâ€™ll be focusing on only cleaning up the dataset using tools and methods.
The goal is to provide a clear and comprehensive record of the cleaning process.

Objectives
The specific objectives of this challenge are:
-To eliminate errors and inconsistencies
-To ensure data accuracy.
-To resolve conflicts between data fields and data types.
-Removing duplicates.
To achieve these objectives, I had to consider factors such as incorrect data format, removing duplicate columns, removing special characters, etc.
this will improve the quality and reliability of the data.
